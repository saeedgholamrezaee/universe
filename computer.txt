### Path to find any file with name to achive to modules:	
## these are five method for compile program directory and subdirectory:
1- relational and absulot path
2- use compiler flag -I -L and use program same pkg-conf, xcrun to set compile flag
3- use environment variable such as pythonpath
5- set building system path such as project_path on cmake
6- xcode and set this on language flag same -I

compile type:

1- work with compiler on command line
2- use of batch file for automate compile
3- use of build generator such as make and ninja
4- use of building manager such as autotools, meson, cmake
5- use of IDE for build project

compile run link load dynamicLink/time

tools:

assembler compiler interpreter runtime debuger test analyzer 
building generator and manager, package and dependency manager
template manager, template engine, 

package:

object file, executable, static ar lib jar, share so dylib dll framework
package as source and binary, operation system package

create package or library and use of that in application/remote/user/system/internet wide
on unix freeBSD macos linux windows

java/.NET create package and use of that in application/system/remote
java classpath and project manager maven
.NET GAC nuget
