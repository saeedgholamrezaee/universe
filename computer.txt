Find Modules PATH: preprocessor, compile time, link time, run time, dynamic link time

1- relational and absulot path
2- use compiler flag -I -L and use program same pkg-conf, xcrun to set compile flag
3- use environment variable such as pythonpath
5- set building system path such as project_path on cmake
6- xcode and set this on language flag same -I

Build Ecosystem types: build[phase[pre, post], tool/system/executor, generator, manager]

1- work with compiler on command line and set flags option switch arguman command
2- use of batch file for automate compile
3- use of build generator such as make and ninja
4- use of building manager such as autotools, meson, cmake
5- use of IDE for build project
