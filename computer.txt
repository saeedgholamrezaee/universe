##these are five method for compile program directory and subdirectory:

1- relational and absulot path
2- use compiler flag -I -L
3- use environment variable such as pythonpath
4- use of program such as pkg-conf and xcrun
5- set building system path such as project_path on cmake
6- xcode and set this on language flag same -I

compile type:

1- work with compiler on command line
2- use of batch file for automate compile
3- use of build generator such as make and ninja
4- use of building manager such as autotools, meson, cmake
5- use of IDE for build project

compile time and run time

tools:

assembler compiler interpreter runtime debuger test analyzer 
building generator and manager, package and dependency manager
template manager, template engine, 

package:

object file, executable, static ar lib jar, share so dylib dll framework
package as source and binary, operation system package

create package on application/user/system/internet wide

Toolchain
Toolchain = مجموعه ابزارهای برای ساخت (build) یک برنامه C/C++
(gcc / clang / msvc)

(ld / lld / link.exe)

استاندارد کتابخانه C/C++ (libstdc++ / libc++ / msvc STL)

مسیرهای include و lib

تنظیمات وابستگی (dependencies)

تنظیمات ABI، architecture و build type
